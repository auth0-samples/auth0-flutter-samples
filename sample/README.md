# Flutter Sample App

This sample app demonstrates the integration of the Auth0 Flutter SDK into a Flutter app. The sample is a companion to the [Auth0 Flutter Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/flutter/interactive).

## Requirements

- Flutter 3+
- Xcode 14.x / 15.x (for iOS/macOS)
- Android Studio 4+ (for Android)

> [!NOTE]
> On iOS 17.4+ and macOS 14.4+ it is possible to use Universal Links as callback and logout URLs. auth0_flutter will fall back to using a custom URL scheme on older iOS / macOS versions.
>
> **This feature requires Xcode 15.3+ and a paid Apple Developer account**.
>
> If you do not have a paid Apple Developer account, skip **step 3** and set the `useHTTPS` parameter to `false` in the `login()` and `logout()` calls at `lib/example_app.dart`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On every step, if you have a¬†[custom domain](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/custom-domains), replace the `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `{DOMAIN}` placeholders with your custom domain instead of the value from the settings page.

## 1. Configure the Auth0 Application

### üì± Mobile/Desktop

Go to the settings page of your [Auth0 application](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/) and add the following URLs to **Allowed Callback URLs** and **Allowed Logout URLs**, depending on the platform you want to use.

#### Android

```text
SCHEME://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/android/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME/callback
```

#### iOS

```text
https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/ios/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback,
YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/ios/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback
```

#### macOS

```text
https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/macos/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback,
YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/macos/YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER/callback
```

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

If your iOS bundle identifier were `com.example.MyApp` and your Auth0 Domain were `example.us.auth0.com`, then this value would be:

```text
https://example.us.auth0.com/ios/com.example.MyApp/callback,
com.example.MyApp://example.us.auth0.com/ios/com.example.MyApp/callback
```
</details>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the Auth0 application type is **Native**. Otherwise, you might run into errors due to the different configurations of other application types.

### üåê Web

Go to the settings page of your [Auth0 application](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/) and configure the following URLs:

- Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
- Allowed Logout URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
- Allowed Web Origins: `http://localhost:3000`

## 2. Configure the SDK

### üì±üåê Mobile/Desktop/Web

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the `{CLIENT_ID}` and `{DOMAIN}` placeholders with the Client ID and domain of your Auth0 application.

```sh
AUTH0_DOMAIN={DOMAIN}
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID={CLIENT_ID}
AUTH0_CUSTOM_SCHEME=com.auth0.sample # For Android
```

### Android: Configure the string resources

In the sample, we are using values referenced from `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`. Rename `strings.xml.example` to `strings.xml` and replace the `{DOMAIN}` placeholder with the domain of your Auth0 application.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="com_auth0_domain">{DOMAIN}</string>
    <string name="com_auth0_scheme">com.auth0.sample</string>
</resources>
```

## 3. iOS/macOS: Configure the associated domain

### Configure the entitlements

Open `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` (or `macos/Runner.xcodeproj`, for macOS) in Xcode and go to the settings of the **Runner** target. In the **Signing & Capabilities** tab, change the default bundle identifier from `com.auth0.samples.SwiftSample` to another value of your choosing. Then, ensure the **Automatically manage signing** box is checked, and that your Apple Team is selected.

Under **Associated Domains**, find the following entry:

```text
webcredentials:YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN
```

Replace the `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` placeholder with the domain of your Auth0 application.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

If your Auth0 Domain were `example.us.auth0.com`, then this value would be:

```text
webcredentials:example.us.auth0.com
```
</details>

### Configure the Team ID and bundle identifier

Open the settings page of your Auth0 application, scroll to the end, and open **Advanced Settings > Device Settings**. In the **iOS** section, set **Team ID** to your [Apple Team ID](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-your-team/locate-your-team-id/), and **App ID** to the app's bundle identifier.

![Screenshot of the iOS section inside the Auth0 application settings page](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift/assets/5055789/7eb5f6a2-7cc7-4c70-acf3-633fd72dc506)

This will add the app to your Auth0 tenant's `apple-app-site-association` file.

> [!NOTE]
> For the associated domain to work, the app must be signed with your team certificate **even when building for the iOS simulator**. Make sure you are using the Apple Team whose Team ID is configured in the settings page of your Auth0 application.

## 4. Run the sample

Use the [Flutter CLI](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli) to run the app.

### üì± Mobile/Desktop

```sh
flutter run
```

Ensure you have at least one emulator/simulator running. If you have multiple running, the CLI will prompt you to select the one to run the app on.

### üåê Web

```sh
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000 --web-renderer html
```
