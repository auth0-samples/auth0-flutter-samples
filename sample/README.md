# Flutter Sample App

This sample app demonstrates the integration of the Auth0 Flutter SDK into a Flutter app. The sample is a companion to the [Auth0 Flutter Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/flutter/interactive).

## Requirements

- Flutter 3+
- Xcode 14+ (for iOS)
- Android Studio 4+ (for Android)

## Configure Auth0 Application

### üì± Mobile

Go to the settings page of your [Auth0 application](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/) and add the corresponding URL to **Allowed Callback URLs** and **Allowed Logout URLs**, according to the app target you want to run. If you are using a [custom domain](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/custom-domains), replace `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` with the value of your custom domain instead of the value from the settings page.

**Android**

```text
SCHEME://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/android/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME/callback
```

**iOS**

```text
YOUR_BUNDLE_ID://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/ios/YOUR_BUNDLE_ID/callback
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Web

Go to the settings page of your [Auth0 application](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/) and configure the following URLs:

- Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
- Allowed Logout URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
- Allowed Web Origins: `http://localhost:3000`

## Configure Auth0 Flutter

The sample app uses [flutter_dotenv](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dotenv) for its configuration. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and provide the appropriate **domain** and **Client Id**. Optionally, when using Android, you can configure the scheme as well. This can be set to a custom scheme, or `https` if you want to use [Android App Links](https://auth0.com/docs/applications/enable-android-app-links). You can read more about setting this value in the [Auth0.Android SDK README](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.Android#a-note-about-app-deep-linking).

```sh
AUTH0_DOMAIN={DOMAIN}
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID={CLIENT_ID}
# AUTH0_CUSTOM_SCHEME=SCHEME
```

### Android

In the sample, we are using values referenced from `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`. Rename `strings.xml.example` to `strings.xml` and fill in the respective values.

- `com_auth0_domain`: The domain of your Auth0 tenant. Generally, you can find this in the Auth0 Dashboard under your application's settings in the **Domain** field. If you are using a custom domain, you should set this to the value of your custom domain instead.
- `com_auth0_scheme`: The scheme to use. Can be a custom scheme, or `https` if you want to use [Android App Links](https://auth0.com/docs/applications/enable-android-app-links). You can read more about setting this value in the [Auth0.Android SDK README](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.Android#a-note-about-app-deep-linking).

### iOS

The sample has already configured the required **Url Types**  to ensure the callback and logout URLs can reach the app, so there is nothing to configure in order to run the sample on iOS.

## Run the sample

To run the project, use the [Flutter CLI's](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli) `run` command.

### üì± Mobile

```sh
flutter run
```

Ensure you have at least one emulator running. If you have multiple running, the CLI will prompt you to select the one to run the app on.

### üñ•Ô∏è Web

```sh
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000 --web-renderer html
```

## Compile the sample

To compile the project, use the [Flutter CLI's](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli) `build` command, including the platform you want to target.

```sh
flutter build apk
flutter build ios
flutter build web
```

## Issue Reporting

For general support or usage questions, use the [Auth0 Community](https://community.auth0.com/c/sdks/5) forums or raise a [support ticket](https://support.auth0.com/). Only [raise an issue](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-flutter-samples/issues) if you have found a bug or want to request a feature.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple sources](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers), either social identity providers such as **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce** (amongst others), or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, or any SAML identity provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile through [JavaScript Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions).

**Why Auth0?** Because you should save time, be happy, and focus on what really matters: building your product.
